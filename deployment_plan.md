# Vercel Deployment Configuration

This document outlines the deployment configuration for the Scheduling Agent application using Vercel.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:
- `backend/`: Node.js backend API
- `frontend/scheduling_agent_frontend/`: Next.js frontend application

## Deployment Strategy

We'll use a monorepo approach with the following components:
1. Frontend: Deployed directly on Vercel
2. Backend API: Deployed as Vercel Serverless Functions
3. Database: MongoDB Atlas (cloud-hosted)
4. n8n Workflow Engine: Self-hosted on a separate server

## Environment Setup

We'll configure three environments:
1. Development
2. Staging
3. Production

Each environment will have its own:
- Vercel project
- MongoDB database
- Environment variables

## CI/CD Pipeline

We'll use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, with the following workflow:
1. Run tests on pull requests
2. Automatically deploy to development on merge to development branch
3. Automatically deploy to staging on merge to staging branch
4. Require manual approval for production deployments

## Implementation Steps

1. Prepare the project for Vercel deployment
2. Set up GitHub repository
3. Configure Vercel projects
4. Set up environment variables
5. Configure GitHub Actions
6. Deploy to development environment
7. Test and validate
8. Set up staging and production environments
